Country of origin and history.</p>
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The story behind the Webtoon starts in the mid-2000s, when the internet became popular in South Korea and people started accessing online content more often. At this time, traditional comics were still very popular in the country, but the comic book publishing industry was facing financial and distribution challenges.</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">  With that came the first Webtoons, which became a cheaper and more convenient alternative for readers.</p>
  <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">The first webtoon-style stories were short black-and-white stories published on online comics websites and forums at the time. Over time, Webtoons evolved, both in terms of quality and popularity, incorporating new elements such as colors, animation and interactivity to make the reading experience more attractive for readers.</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">From 2010, webtoons began to expand to other markets, such as Japan, China and the United States, and to gain more and more international recognition. Today they are a popular form of entertainment in many countries around the world, and many artists and writers see the format as an accessible and flexible way to tell stories and connect with a global audience.</p>
